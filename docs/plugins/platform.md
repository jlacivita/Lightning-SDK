# Platform

Sometimes your App might need to interact with the Platform it's running on. For example to retrieve information about the user profile, localization, the capabilities of the device or global accesibility settings.

Getting access to this information requires to connect to lower level APIs made available by the platform. Since implementations differ between operators and platforms, the Lightning-SDK offers a Platform plugin, that exposes a generic, agnostic interface to the developer.

Under the hood, an underlaying transport layer will then take care of calling the right APIs for the actual platform implementation that your App is running on.

The Platform plugin is most often used to _retrieve_ information from the Platform. In some cases it can also be used to _pass_ information back to the Platform. This might differ per platform.

The Platform plugin is divided into 4 different sections: Localization, User, Device, Accesibility.

## Usage

Whenever you need to interact with the Platform, import the Platform plugin from the Lightning SDK

```js
import { Platform } from '@lightningjs/sdk'
```

All methods on the Platform plugin can act as a getter and a setter (when permitted by the platform).
Whenever a method is called without params it will _return_ data (in the form of a Promise).
Whenever parameters are passed to the method, it will _send_ those on to the lower level platform APIs
(attempting to update a value).

## Available methods

### Localization

#### City

Gets the city. `New York` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.Localization.city()
```


#### ZipCode

Gets the zipCode. Returns `27505` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.Localization.zipCode()
```

#### CountryCode

Gets the countryCode. Returns `US` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.Localization.countryCode()
```

#### LatLon

Gets the LatLon. During _local development_ will try to return your actual latitude and longitude from a remote API service. If unsuccessful, will default to `[40.7128, 74.006]`.
If during _local development_ you want to force to use the browser's built in _geolocation_ for retrieving the latitude and longitude, add the key `forceBrowserGeolocation` with the value `true` as a _platform setting_ in `settings.json`.

```js
Platform.Localization.latLon()
```

#### Locale

Get the locale. During _local development_ will attempt to return the browser's locale, with a fallback to to `en-US`.

```js
Platform.Localization.locale()
```

#### Language

Gets the language. During _local development_ will attempt to return the browser's language, with a default to `en`.

```js
Platform.Localization.language()
```

### User

#### ageRating

Gets the ageRating. Returns `adult` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.User.ageRating()
```

### Device

#### Ip

Gets the ip. Returns `127.0.0.1` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.Device.ip()
```

#### Household

Gets the houseHold-id. Returns `b2244e9d4c04826ccd5a7b2c2a50e7d4` by default during _local development_.

```js

```js
Platform.Device.type()
```

#### Model

Gets the model of the device running the App. Returns `Metrological` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.Device.type()
```

#### Hdcp

Gets the supported HDCP profiles. Returns `{enabled: true, negotiatedVersion: 'HDCP2.2', maxVersion: 'HDCP2.3` }` by default during _local development_.

```js
Platform.Accesibility.voiceGuidance()
```

## Overwriting default values

During development you might want to test your App with different platform values (i.e. a different language, age rating or device IP).
When you want to overwrite the default values, you can do so by editing the `settings.json` file.
Add a `platform` key in `platformSettings` and only add the values you wish to change here.

```json
{
  "platformSettings": {
      "platform": {
          "localization": {
            "city": "New York",
            "zipCode": "27505",
            "countryCode": "US",
            "language": "en",
            "latlon": [40.7128, 74.006],
            "locale": "en-US"
          },
          "user": {
            "ageRating": "adult"
          },
          "device": {
            "ip": "127.0.0.1",
            "household": "b2244e9d4c04826ccd5a7b2c2a50e7d4",
            "mac": "00:00:00:00:00:00",
            "operator": "Metrological",
            "platform": "Metrological",
            "packages": [],
            "uid": "ee6723b8-7ab3-462c-8d93-dbf61227998e",
            "stbType": "Metrological",
            "hdcp": "HDR10",
            "resolution": [1920, 1080],
            "name": "Living Room",
            "network": {
              "state": "Connected",
              "type": "WIFI"
            }
          },
          "accesibility": {
            "closedCaptions": {"enabled": false},
            "voiceGuidance": {"enabled": true, "speed": 5}
